          <p class="htmlrpg-italic">This evening, we will use our innate connection to the realm of spirits to channel the one that haunts these halls. We shall learn of the message which it

          <h2>How To Play</h2>

            <p>In Séance, players take on the role of
            mid-19th century Mediums attempting to
            communicate with a troublesome Spirit.</p>

            <p>This is a co-operative role-playing game.
            That means you should speak and act as your
            character would. You’ll also get a chance to
            play the role of the Spirit.</p>
            
            <p>The ultimate goal is to reveal each Medium’s
            Message and piece together the story of the
            Spirit.</p>

            <h3>What you’ll need:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>At least two willing participants.</li>

                <li>Paper.</li>
                <li>A 5 minute timer.</li>
              </ol>

              <ol>
                <li>Read the rules.</li>
                <li>Set the mood if you’d like. Candles, crystal balls, and appropriate music can all help players get in to their roles.</li>
                <li>Write down your Medium’s name,
                appearance, 10 Channeling Points, and a
                Message. Extra details are welcome, but not
                mechanically significant.</li>

                <li>Introduce your Mediums.</li>
                <li>Whenever you’re ready to begin in earnest,
                  the player who most recently experienced
                  something unexplainable begins Channeling
                  !e Spirit.</li>
