          <p class="htmlrpg-italic">Welcome, Mediums, to our Séance.</p>

          <p class="htmlrpg-italic">This evening, we will use our innate connection to the realm of spirits to channel the one that haunts these halls. We shall learn of the message which it
          wishes to impart to the land of the living, and we shall a"empt to piece together its ghastly tale so that it may #nd peace.</p>

          <p class="htmlrpg-italic">Prepare yourselves in mind, body, and most importantly, spirit.</p>

          <h2>How To Play</h2>

            <p>In Séance, players take on the role of
            mid-19th century Mediums attempting to
            communicate with a troublesome Spirit.</p>

            <p>This is a co-operative role-playing game.
            That means you should speak and act as your
            character would. You’ll also get a chance to
            play the role of the Spirit.</p>
            
            <p>The ultimate goal is to reveal each Medium’s
            Message and piece together the story of the
            Spirit.</p>

            <h3>What you’ll need:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>At least two willing participants.</li>
                <li>Writing implements.</li>
                <li>Paper.</li>
                <li>A 5 minute timer.</li>
              </ol>

            <h3>To get started:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Read the rules.</li>
                <li>Set the mood if you’d like. Candles, crystal balls, and appropriate music can all help players get in to their roles.</li>
                <li>Write down your Medium’s name,
                appearance, 10 Channeling Points, and a
                Message. Extra details are welcome, but not
                mechanically significant.</li>
                <li>Read the Introduction out loud.</li>
                <li>Introduce your Mediums.</li>
                <li>Whenever you’re ready to begin in earnest,
                  the player who most recently experienced
                  something unexplainable begins Channeling
                  !e Spirit.</li>

            <h2>Rules</h2>

            <p><strong>Your Character.</strong> This game takes place in the
            mid 1800s. Pick an appropriate name and
            persona. That’s your Medium, and you act as
            them unless you’re Channeling The Spirit.</p>

            <p><strong>The Message.</strong> While writing down your
            Medium’s details, you should secretly write
            down one word on a separate piece of paper.
            "is word is your Message. It should be
            speci#c. Avoid common words that occur
            frequently in casual conversation. Your goal
            is to get other Mediums to guess your
            Message while you’re Channeling "e Spirit.
            You can never say your Message out loud,
            write it down (aside from during character
            creation), spell it out, or otherwise give it
            away. Instead, you must provide hints and
            clues. If another Medium correctly guesses
            your Message, immediately reveal your
            Message and place it in the middle of the
            table.</p>

            <p>Channeling !e Spirit. To Channel !e
            Spirit, deduct 1 Channeling Point from your
            Medium. Whomever is Channeling "e Spirit
            resumes the role of their Medium and you
            begin speaking and acting as the Spirit
            instead.</p>

            <p>When a Medium #rst starts Channeling, start
            a 5 minute timer. All other Mediums should
            engage them to learn more about the Spirit.
            A$er 5 minutes have passed, other Mediums
            may spend Channeling Points to take over if
            they wish.</p>

            <p>While Channeling, you should either use
            mannerisms, voices, accents, and behaviors
            previously established by other Mediums, or
            introduce new ones. You may shape the
            Spirit’s personality and traits as you wish, as
            long as you never contradict a trait already
            established by another Medium. "e Spirit
            will become more concrete as each Medium
            has a chance to shape them by Channeling.</p>
